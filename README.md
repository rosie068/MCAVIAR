MsCAVIAR is a method for fine-mapping (identifying causal variants among GWAS associated variants) by leveraging information from multiple studies. One important application area is trans-ethnic fine mapping. Details on installing and using MsCAVIAR are below. If you would like further details, see the paper below; if you use the software, please cite it.
